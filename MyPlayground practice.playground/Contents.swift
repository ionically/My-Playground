import UIKit
//using break in loop
//it is used to control the loops
//break stops looping at a stand when it is used to func control
//suppose
var age = 15
for i in 1...14 {
    print(i)
    //hence if i had to control it till 5 or 6
    //then i say
    
    if i == 6 {
        break
    }
}
for i in 1...15 {
    print(i)
    if i == 5 {
        break
    }
}
//so thats what break does it terminates the loop
